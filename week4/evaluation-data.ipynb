I am wondering why and what is the right way, although it doesn't make a difference!\\nDid you try using a different random_state? From my understanding, KFold just makes N (which is equal to n_splits) separate pairs of datasets (train+val).\\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html\\nIn my case changing random state changed results\\n(Arthur Minakhmetov)\\nChanging the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop\\n(Bhaskar Sarma)\\nIn case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained. I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.\\n(Ani Mkrtumyan)\",\n",

       "  'answer_orig': \"I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?\\nNot necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).\\nBy Rileen Sinha\",\n",
