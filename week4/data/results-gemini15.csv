On Ubuntu, run

On Windows, the easiest way to install wget is to use Chocolatey:
choco install wget
Or you can download a binary from here and put it to any location in your PATH (e.g. C:/tools/)
On Mac, the easiest way to install wget is to use brew.
Brew install wget
Alternatively, you can use a Python wget library, but instead of simply using “wget” you’ll need eeeto use
python -m wget
You need to install it with pip first:
pip install wget
And then in your python code, for example in your jupyter notebook, use:
import wget
wget.download(""URL"")
This should download whatever is at the URL in the same directory as your code.

Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, gs, and file.
In some cases you might need to bypass https checks:

You can also use the “upload file” functionality from GitHub for that
If you write your code on Google colab you can also directly share it on your Github.

To perform matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the 1st matrix should match the number of rows in the 2nd matrix. You can rearrange the order to make sure that this satisfies the condition.

In this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.
-Mohammad Emad Sharifi-",1091b10f,What is one-hot encoding in machine learning?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
443,"To resolve the issue of converting a string to a float, you can use one-hot encoding. This method creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column. For example, you can use the pandas library to perform one-hot encoding:
```python
import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
```
This code will create a new DataFrame where the 'brand' column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., 'brand_Nissan', 'brand_Toyota', etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns. 
","The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.
To resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.
Here’s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:

When we apply the fit method, this method is looking at the content of the df_train dictionaries we are passing to the DictVectorizer instance, and fit is figuring out (training) how to map the values of these dictionaries. If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.
With this context, if we apply the fit to the validation model, we are ""giving the answers"" and we are not letting the ""fit"" do its job for data that we haven't seen. By not applying the fit to the validation model we can know how well it was trained.

The correct way is to fit_transform the train set, and only transform the validation and test sets.

Below is an extract of Alexey's book explaining this point. Hope is useful
When we apply the fit method, this method is looking at the content of the df_train dictionaries we are passing to the DictVectorizer instance, and fit is figuring out (training) how to map the values of these dictionaries. If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.
With this context, if we apply the fit to the validation model, we are ""giving the answers"" and we are not letting the ""fit"" do its job for data that we haven't seen. By not applying the fit to the validation model we can know how well it was trained.
Below is an extract of Alexey's book explaining this point.

663,"Changing the random_state parameter in KFold affects the results because it changes the way the data is split into training and validation sets. This is because KFold uses a random number generator to shuffle the data before splitting it.

This can lead to different results, as the model will be trained on different data.

","While weeks 1-4 can relatively easily be followed and the associated homework completed with just about any default environment / local setup, week 5 introduces several layers of abstraction and dependencies.
It is advised to prepare your “homework environment” with a cloud provider of your choice. A thorough step-by-step guide for doing so for an AWS EC2 instance is provided in an introductory video taken from the MLOPS course here:

Note that (only) small AWS instances can be run for free, and that larger ones will be billed hourly based on usage (but can and should be stopped when not in use).

803,"During development and testing, the `--rm` flag is used to automatically remove containers upon exit. This prevents containers from accumulating in a stopped state and taking up space. 
","What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?
For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.
They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.

1040,"Bagging, used in Random Forest, involves training multiple models in parallel using bootstrapped samples from the original training data. The final output is an aggregation (e.g., average) of the predictions from all models. Boosting, used in XGBoost, trains models sequentially, with each model learning from the errors of its predecessors. Weights are assigned to models based on their performance, giving more weight to better-performing models in the final prediction. 
","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.
Mélanie Fouesnard
Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

If your Docker image is built on the base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10), use specific ports for ""docker run"" and a specific ""localhost link"" for testing. After running the image as a container with the command ""docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name,"" an endpoint will start up locally at: localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations.

","This deployment setup can be tested locally using AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator).
Basically, if your Docker image was built upon base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10) - just use certain ports for “docker run” and a certain “localhost link” for testing:
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
This command runs the image as a container and starts up an endpoint locally at:
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations
Post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command:
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'
Examples of curl testing:
* windows testing:
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d ""{\""url\"": \""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg\""}""

If during testing you encounter an error like this:

Allocator (GPU_0_bfc) ran out of memory trying to allocate 6.88GiB with freed_by_count=0. The caller indicates that this is not a failure, but this may mean that there could be performance gains if more memory were available.
Try adding this code in a cell at the beginning of your notebook:
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
After doing this most of my issues went away. I say most because there was one instance when I still got the error once more, but only during one epoch. I ran the code again, right after it finished, and I never saw the error again.

1659,"When using waitress, the pickle.load function will try to find __main__.<custom_class>, which does not exist. To avoid this, put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model and the script that loads the model. 
","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.
When using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.
Solution:
Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)
Note: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).

Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
